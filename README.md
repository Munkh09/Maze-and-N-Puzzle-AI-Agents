# Title: Maze and N-Puzzle AI Agents

# Description:
# In this project, I developed the above AI agents that either use A* or BFS search algorithms to reach the goal state
# The user can change the maze or N-puzzle structures dynamically and set a particular initial and goal states
# For the Maze problem, when the script runs, the user will see the agent solving the maze in real-time. When the agent reaches
# the goal state, it will reconstruct the shortest path, and this will also be seen in real-time.

# In terms of the N-puzzle problem, I implemented a simpler visualization using the tabulate library, which simply prints the states
# in pretty formats in the console. Similar to the Maze agent's visualization, the optimal path will be shown (printed) at the end.

# Installation (Setup) Instructions:
# 1. Clone the repository
# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
# 3. pip install -r requirements.txt
# 4. execute the scripts
